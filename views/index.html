        <p> "The Solar System formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar
            molecular cloud. The vast majority of the system's mass is in the Sun, with the majority of the remaining
            mass contained in Jupiter. The four smaller inner planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, are terrestrial
            planets, being primarily composed of rock and metal. The four outer planets are giant planets, being
            substantially more massive than the terrestrials. The two largest planets, Jupiter and Saturn, are gas
            giants, being composed mainly of hydrogen and helium; the two outermost planets, Uranus and Neptune, are ice
            giants, being composed mostly of substances with relatively high melting points compared with hydrogen and
            helium, called volatiles, such as water, ammonia and methane. All eight planets have almost circular orbits
            that lie within a nearly flat disc called the ecliptic." ("Solar System", n.d.)
