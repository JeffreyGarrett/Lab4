        <p> "Pluto was discovered by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930 and declared to be the ninth planet from the Sun. After
            1992, its status as a planet was questioned following the discovery of several objects of similar size in
            the Kuiper belt. In 2005, Eris, a dwarf planet in the scattered disc which is 27% more massive than Pluto,
            was discovered. This led the International Astronomical Union (IAU) to define the term "planet" formally in
            2006, during their 26th General Assembly. That definition excluded Pluto and reclassified it as a dwarf
            planet."  ("Pluto", n.d.).
