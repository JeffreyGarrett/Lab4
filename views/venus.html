        <p> "Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. As the
            second-brightest natural object in the night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and can be, on rare
            occasion, visible to the naked eye in broad daylight.[15][16] Venus lies within Earth's orbit, and so never
            appears to venture far from the Sun, either setting in the west just after dusk or rising in the east a bit
            before dawn. Venus orbits the Sun every 224.7 Earth days.[17] With a rotation period of 243 Earth days, it
            takes longer to rotate about its axis than any other planet in the Solar System and does so in the opposite
            direction to all but Uranus (meaning the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east).[18] Venus does not
            have any moons, a distinction it shares only with Mercury among planets in the Solar System." ("Venus", n.d.)
